[AI/CV/Data Science @ Philippine Space Agency](https://philsa.gov.ph/). [MSc (Distinction) from the Uni of Surrey (CVSSP)](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing). 

Hi! I'm Lois (Lowis)! I am currently working as an Information Technology Officer at the Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA). My duties and responsibilities include:
* conduct research and development related to AI and determine the applicability of research results to the implementation of other PhilSA research and projects, and collaborate with internal and external divisions/offices in the application of these R&D results
* design, implement, and facilitate training sessions on topics resulting from technical research
* perform know-how technology transfer through seminars and/or workshops for PhilSA personnel and external stakeholders
* contribute to the discussions and provide technical expertise in the implementation of PhilSA's planned and ongoing programs, projects, and activities
* assist the PhilSA technical divisions by providing relevant expertise in satellite image processing

I finished my Computer Vision, Robotics, and Machine Learning MSc from the [Uni of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing). My dissertation was done under the supervision of [Prof Dr Miroslaw Bober](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/miroslaw-bober) and was externally examined by [Dr Muhammad Awais Rana](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/muhammad-awais). It focused on the reliability assessment of computer vision models which later was nominated to the department's MSc Project Prize. 

Research Interests:
* AI/CV/Data Science for Earth Observation
* Domain Generalization and Adaptation
* OOD/Distribution Shifts
* Reliable/Trustworthy AI

I am currently rendering my return of service for the country and working hard to prepare for my PhD by the end of 2025 or 2026!
