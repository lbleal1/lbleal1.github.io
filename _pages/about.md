Hi! I am a Senior Research Science Specialist at the Philippine Space Agency, working on Computer Vision and Data Analysis focusing on satellite data.

I just finished my Computer Vision, Robotics, and Machine Learning MSc at the University of Surrey with a dissertation focusing on the reliability assessment of computer vision models. My supervisor was Miroslaw Bober. I plan to take my PhD by 2025 or 2026. I'm primarily interested with improving the reliability of AI models against out-of-distribution (OOD) data through Domain Generalization and Continual Learning.
